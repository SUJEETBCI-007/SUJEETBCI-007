 Hello, World! 🌍 (BINDU COMPUTER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY)

Hi! I'm Sujeet Singh — a freelance penetration tester engaged in bug bounty programs and a cybersecurity student at ITMO University, Russia. I'm passionate about ethical hacking, vulnerability research, and reporting security flaws to companies. I also work with Wi-Fi networks and have hands-on experience with configuring routers, switches, hubs, and servers. With a background in network engineering and software development, I enjoy contributing to the cybersecurity community by sharing my knowledge and projects on GitHub. 🌐💡🥷👨‍💻
